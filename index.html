        <h1>How Do Allegiances Impact Characters Behaviors In The Play Romeo And Juliet</h1>
    </header>

    <div class=".fade-in-text" id="evidence">
        <h1>Evidence 1</h1>
        <p>Romeo: Well, juliet, I will lie with thee tonight</p>
        <h1>Evidence 2</h1>
        <p>Tybalt: Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: though art a villain. <br><br>
            Romeo:
            Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.
            Villain am I none. Therefore, farewell. I see thou know'st me not. <br><br> Tybalt: Boy, this shall not
            excuse
            the injuries That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.</p>
        <h1>Evidence 3</h1>
        <p>Romeo: O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss I die</p>
    </div>

    <div id="expln">
        <h1>Explanation 1</h1>
        <p>In the first quote Romeo learns that Juliet has died, he then decides to kill himself. This is a
            demonstration of Romeo's allegiance to Juliet and this allegiance causes him to make the drastic decision to
            kill himself</p>
        <h1>Explanation 2</h1>
        <p>This second quote demonstrates allegiances influencing the Characters behavior because Tybalt isn't willing
            to listen to Romeo just because he has an allegiance to his family who is a sworn enemy of Romeo's family,
            therefore Tybalt's allegiance to his family is causing him to come in conflict with Romeo.</p>
        <h1>Explanation 3</h1>
        <p>This third quote demonstrates allegiances influencing the Characters behavior because in this quote kills
            himself because of his allegiance to Juliet, he will do anything to be with her so he kills himself.</p>
